In that way, if an employee has food poisoning (reason group 3) for example it is 22 more likely to being absent. By itself this information on reason seems obvious, but we can infer more interesting observations. People with high transportation expenses are way more likely to be absent, so it's in the company best interest to reduce this load and thereby increasing productivy.\n","<br></br>\n","<br></br>\n","Employees with on the second group (33-39 years) have a higher probability of being absent when compared to the base line (27 years). A possible explanation is that for this age is very common to have younger children wich need constant care. This makes sense considering having a child increases the odds of being absent.

Also, it's clear that younger employees are also way less likely to be absent. \n","<br></br>\n","<br></br>\n","Grouping age and reasons in the early preprocessing of the dataset proved to be an efficient way of drawing conclusions, since not doing so would result in a huge amount of variables to be analysed.
