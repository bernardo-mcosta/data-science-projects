# Data science portfolio by Bernardo Costa
 A collection of Data Science projects I've done

## Study Projects
These mostly consist on projects focused on learning the key aspects of machine learning,  overall libraries usage, data manipulation and data visualization. Some of them are case studies from Data Science courses I've took. 

### *Currently Working on*: Surviving the Titanic

[github](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/titanic/Titanic.ipynb) / [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/titanic/Titanic.ipynb)

Predicting who survived the Titanic disaster is the most famous [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) competition and is also a great way for anyone to start practicing machine learning. The goal is to classify whether someone survived or not the shipreck. My first try achieved and accuracy of roughly 77% using a simple Logistic Regression, but I'm currently experimenting with other regression models. This problem is quite interesting for data exploration and manipulation and getting insights of the who had more chances of surviving without even building the model. 

### Startup Investment Opportunities

This is a Multilinear Regression problem in which a Venture Capital Fund is looking for profitable startups to invest into. The dataset given is already mostly preprocessed and contains information of 50 different startups, such as expenses and locations and the goal is to build a model wich can predict the profit. It mainly focuses on data visualization, stardarizing variables and dealing with multiple inputs. 

### Employee Absenteeism Prediction

Part 1 - Preprocessing: [github](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/absenteeism-prediction/Abstenteeism_Preprocessing.ipynb) / [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/absenteeism-prediction/Abstenteeism_Preprocessing.ipynb)

Part 2 - Processing: [github](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/absenteeism-prediction/Abstenteeism_Processing.ipynb) / [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/absenteeism-prediction/Abstenteeism_Processing.ipynb)

The task proposed is to create a Logistic Regression model to predict how likely it is for an employee to be absent from work during normal working hours, given some inputs regarding various employee characteristics, such as age, number of children, distance to work and others. In order to achieve this goal, data regarding characteristics of employees along with past absenteeism information is provided.

### Audiobook Customer Conversion
Part 1 - Preprocessing: [github](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/audiobook-clients/Audiobooks_business_case_preprocessing.ipynb) / [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/audiobook-clients/Audiobooks_business_case_preprocessing.ipynb)

Part 2 - Processing: [github](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/audiobook-clients/Audiobooks_business_case_processing.ipynb) / [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/audiobook-clients/Audiobooks_business_case_processing.ipynb)

This is a Machine Learning Classification problem that consists on estimating the likelihood of an audiobook customer making another purchase (conversion), given past purchases and usage information. If a potential recurring customer can be identified, marketing campaings can be more effectively by focusing efforts and resources to these clients. This project deals with imbalanced dataset and some data manipulation, as wells as using Deep Learning to build the model. 

### MNIST Classification

[github](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/mnist-tensorflow.ipynb) / [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects/blob/main/notebooks/mnist-tensorflow.ipynb)

MNIST is one of the most popular Machine Learning projects and very useful to get starting on Deep Learning with Tensorflow. The goal is to build a model that is able to correctly assign a digit from 0 to 9 to an handwritten single digit 28x28 pixel image. To train the model, a dataset containing 70,000 images is used, provided by Yann LeCun's website.
