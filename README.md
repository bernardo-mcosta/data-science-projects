# Data science portfolio by Bernardo Costa
 A collection of Data Science projects I've done

## Study Projects
These mostly consist on projects focused on learning the key aspects of machine learning,  overall libraries usage, data manipulation and data visualization. Some of them are case studies from Data Science courses I've took. 

### Startup Investment Opportunities
This is a multilinear regression problem in which a Venture Capital Fund is looking for profitable startups to invest into. The dataset given is already mostly preprocessed and contains information of 50 different startups, such as expenses and locations and the goal is to build a model wich can predict the profit. It mainly focuses on data visualization, stardarizing variables and dealing with multiple inputs.
